## Participatory Mapping using Free and Open software

A mapping course built around the OpenStreetMap(OSM) platform project. OSM is a database that stores Free geographic data that allows everyone to create, use, re-use data for many purposes, including community planning, development and humanitarian work.

## OK, but who or what is MapAm❤re?

MapAm❤re is a brain fart of Erwin Olario, to work with the local communities (formal and informal) of San Juan in Metro Manila to help them develop a better map of their neighbourhoods. "Amore" is the Italian word for love, so it's "Map Love". When Erwin is trying to scrounge for food for the table, he often works as a data wrangler and code mangler.
